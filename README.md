# ðŸ›’ Product Recommendation System â€“ Greensfinge Experiment

This project simulates a simplified product recommendation system, commonly found in e-commerce platforms. It is part of an experiment designed to demonstrate how energy-saving strategies can be integrated into Java applications **without** using the **Greensfinge Framework**.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

The project follows the standard layered architecture with separate packages for service, entity and repository.

## âœ… Description

- `entity.Recommendation`: Contains the business entity class.
- `service.RecommendationService`: Contains the business logic to format a recommendation.
- `repository.RecommendationRepository`: Simulates a database to search the values.

## ðŸ§ª Unit Tests

The test class `RecommendationServiceTest` validates the behavior of the recommendation logic.

In this task, you will see something like this, and the goal is to make all tests pass successfully.
